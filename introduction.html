<h1 class="skyblue">Background:</h1>
<p class="intro">"Johnny Mnemonic" is a cyberpunk short story written by William Gibson released in Omni magazine in May 1981, and was also included in Gibson's "Burnign Chrome". It takes place in the same world as the rest of Gibson's cyberpunk novels and revolves around the character Johnny, a man who can store people's private information in his brain. Later the it was adapted into a film in 1995 that vastly differed from the plot of the short story.</p>

<p class="intro">William Ford Gibson is an American and Canadian author who was born on March 17, 1948, in Conway, South Carolina. Soon after his father passed away, he moved with his mother to WytheVille, Virginia where he spent the majority of his childhood. He spent much of his time in soletude, listening to recordings and reading books and knew from an early age that he wanted to become a science fiction writer. After dropping out of high school at the age of 18, he traveled and emmersed himself in cultures that possessed different values than those of mainstream society. After his travels, Gibson married Deborah Jean Thompson and settled down in Vancouver, British Columbia where he attended the Univeristy of British Columbia. He earned a Bachelor's degree in English and continued his studies to earn a Master's degree in science fiction. During this time, he met people who encouraged him to fully pursue a full time career in writing.</p>

<p class="intro">Gibson's early stories explored technological advances and their future effects on humans. In 1982, Gibson released his short story "Burning Chrome" where he became the first to utilize the term cyberspace, a concept that was later used in his debut novel Neuromancer which was released in 1984. During his career, Gibson has strongly influenced other science fiction authors and revitalized the genre after it had fallen in popularity. He released 10 acclaimed novels and over twenty short stories while also contributing to other various major publications. Other noteworthy works he produced throughout the years are Count Zero, Mona Lisa Overdrive, The Difference Engine, Virtual Light, All Tomorrowâ€™s Parties, Pattern Recognition, Spook Country and Zero History.</p>

<p class="intro">Currently, William Gibson still resides in Vancouver Canada and continues writing science fiction short stories and novels. His most recent work is a novel titled <em>The Peripheral</em>, another science fiction novel set in the future.</p>

<h1 class="skyblue">Editorial Statement:</h1>
<p class="intro">The majority of the design choices I made were done for simplicity and comfort. A black background with white text is most definitely not the most exciting thing on the world; however, it's easy on the reader's eyes. As someone who spends a lot of time staring at bright screens, I know firsthand how straining it can be to look at a white or some other kind of colorful background for an extended period of time. With this color scheme plus a nice font, I feel that it provides a better reading experience than what I had when I first read this story.</p>

<p class="intro">My other real design choices were made in regards to the story. I chose not to add any additional images to the text because I feel like it's important that the reader feels somewhat confused while reading and trying to understand the events that are occuring. I believe that is part of the experiance of "Johnny Mnemonic". Although my own personal exeption to this was in coloring the text representing the light bulbs of the machine to clarify the image. Since that text was written into the story, I don't feel as if I am completely contradicting myself by manipulating the colors.</p>

<p class="intro">The last thing I want to note is the color scheme I chose for the titles, which stems off the previously mentioned colors of the machine. The machine had red, white, and blue bulbs, so I figured I would use red, white, and blue as section titles throught the website. </p>
