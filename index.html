	<h3 class="title">The Edition:</h3>
	<p class="edition"> This is a digital edition of William Gibson's "Johnny Mnemonic" created for the HUMN 271 course at Bucknell University. It is being used as an exericse to practice utilizing HTML, CSS, and Javascript as well as to demonstrate the effects of presentation on an indivudual's reading experience. This site was created and developed by me; however, the story is purely Gibson's work.</p>
